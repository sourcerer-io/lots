# Installing LOTS

```
gem install lots
```

# Running the Game

Just type "lots" on the console.

# Platform Specific Notes

## Windows

I highly recommend the cmdr console prompt with the Consolas font.

## Mac

For best results, use the "Professional" terminal profile.

## Linux

The default terminal for KDE or XFCE works great with LOTS. I tested it with those, but others should work well.
